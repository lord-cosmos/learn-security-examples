- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.

the vulnerability is there is no way of any log mechanism that actually persists somewhere on the server.
the secure version is logging the data using logStream - creating a server log.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

1. probably, an algorithm/mechanism to detect any suspicious activity using logs.
2. auditing.
3. Proper authorization/access control on log data
